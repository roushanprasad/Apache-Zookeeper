Pre Requisites : 
1) Java 1.8 or higher Setup
There are two ways to do this: 
A) MANUAL SETUP
B) Using apt install
Both the methods are described as below: 

A) MANUAL SETUP OF JDK 1.8 -----------------------------------------------------
Download JDK:  
Download JDK 1.8 from the below link and extract it to a location with appropriate permissions, say '/user/java/jdk1.8'
Create the directory (if not already exists)
Download Link -> https://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml

Alternate Paths: 
Use the below alternate path commands to setup the alternate path for the jdk:
For Java, Java Compiler and Java Web Start respectively: 
>sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_152/bin/java" 1
>sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_152/bin/javac" 1
>sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_152/bin/javaws" 1

Please note that the locations: 
/usr/bin/java
/usr/bin/javac
/usr/bin/javaws
are fixed in the command, you only need to change the location that is mentioned in the later part of the command. 
These locations at the later part in the command are the actual location where you have extracted the jdk.

Modify the .bashrc file: 
You can do it either with your current user or with root user. I suggest to do it with root user.
Type the below command when you are root user
>gedit ~/.bashrc

Then add the below lines to the end of the bashrc file 

#JAVA HOME directory setup
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.8.0_152
export PATH="$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin"

Save and close the bashrc file and cource the bashrc file with the below command: 
>source .bashrc

There you are. You have completed the manual installation of JDK 1.8 in linux (ubuntu)
